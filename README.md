Brave New Galaxy
================

<i>Brave New Galaxy</i> is a rogue-like, massively-multiplayer, online galaxy crawler with procedural planet generation and voxel-based terrain. Envisioned as an endless romp through space -- as long as you can keep yourself alive whilst hurtling along the tradelanes of the Milky Way Galaxy -- the game combines aspects of planetary exploration and expansion, resource mining and crafting, social engineering, and warfare all in one single gameplay experience.
