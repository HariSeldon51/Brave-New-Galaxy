An Endless Romp through Space
----------------
###Game Summary
*Brave New Galaxy* is a rogue-like, massively-multiplayer, online galaxy crawler with procedural planet generation and voxel-based terrain. An endless romp through space --- as long as you can keep yourself alive whilst hurtling along the tradelanes of the Milky Way Galaxy --- the game combines aspects of planetary exploration and expansion, resource mining and crafting, social engineering, and warfare all in one single gameplay experience. It is currently in early development as a learning project by Will DeHaven, who is chronicling the experience on his YouTube channel: [BraveNewGalaxyGame](https://www.youtube.com/user/BraveNewGalaxyGame).
